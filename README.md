CRUD-Implementations

The project demonstrates three different implementations of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the "Human" entity using different Java technologies:

1. JdbcTemplate

2. Hibernate

3. Spring Data JPA

Since each of the technologies used has a different level of abstraction, the implementation using a separate technology is in a separate commit to show the progression and differences between the approaches.

Commits

Commit 1: Implementation using JdbcTemplate.

Commit 2: Implementation using Hibernate.

Commit 3: Implementation using Spring Data JPA.
